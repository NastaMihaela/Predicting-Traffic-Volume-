Predicting Traffic Volume on US Interstate Highways Using Weather and Temporal Data 
Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict hourly traffic volume on a major US interstate highway (I-94) using weather, time, and holiday-related data. The project aims to provide insights into how different factors influence traffic patterns, helping improve traffic management, forecasting, and planning. 

Dataset Description: The dataset consists of hourly traffic volume data for westbound I-94, collected by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) between 2012 and 2018. Key features in the dataset include: 

Holiday: A categorical variable indicating whether the data was collected on a US national holiday or a regional holiday (e.g., Minnesota State Fair). 

Temperature (temp): Average temperature in kelvin. 

Rain (rain_1h): Amount of rain (mm) recorded in the past hour. 

Snow (snow_1h): Amount of snow (mm) recorded in the past hour. 

Clouds (clouds_all): Percentage of cloud cover. 

Weather_main: Short description of the weather condition (e.g., Clear, Clouds, Rain). 

Weather_description: Detailed description of the weather condition (e.g., light rain, overcast clouds). 

Date_time: The hour of data collection in local CST time. 

Traffic_volume: Hourly traffic volume for the westbound I-94. 

Potential Applications: 

Traffic Volume Forecasting: Develop regression models to predict traffic volume based on weather conditions, holidays, and time of day, aiding in traffic management and planning. 

Traffic Flow Optimization: The model can be used to optimize traffic control systems, reducing congestion during peak hours or adverse weather conditions. 

Weather Impact Analysis: Analyze the effects of different weather conditions (rain, snow, cloud cover) on traffic volume, supporting city planning and infrastructure improvements. 

Holiday Traffic Patterns: Identify traffic volume trends during holidays and special events, helping local authorities plan for potential surges in traffic. 

Smart City Integration: Use the model as part of smart city initiatives, integrating traffic prediction with intelligent transportation systems to enhance urban mobility. 

Methodology: The project will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand traffic patterns and relationships between the features. After data cleaning and preprocessing, machine learning models such as linear regression, random forests, or gradient boosting will be trained to predict hourly traffic volume. Time-series analysis may also be applied to capture temporal
